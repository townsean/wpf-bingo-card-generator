# wpf-bingo-card-generator

The bingo card generator is a WPF application that generates baby shower themed bingo cards.  The project was written on the eve of my baby shower.  The bingo cards were for a baby shower game. Guests play bingo while the expecting parents (@[nsipid](https://github.com/nsipid) and I) opened up our gifts.  I was not satisfied with existing bingo card options and I wanted something that I could easily customize to match items on our registery.  Currently working on a v2 which will be a web app (see [bingo-card-generator](https://github.com/townsean/bingo-card-generator)).
